== Summary

This section will help you become familiar with using the Amazon FSx console and ONTAP CLI to manage your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file systems.

You can use the Amazon FSx console, AWS CLI or FSx API to create a new file system. In addition to these AWS management tools you can also use NetApp management tools like NetApp Cloud Manager, ONTAP CLI and ONTAP REST API to manage the file system.


== Duration

NOTE: It will take approximately 15 minutes to complete this section.


== Step-by-step Guide (Amazon FSx Console)

=== Examine Amazon FSx Console

. Go to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console, *_Click_* the *File system ID* of your Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system. This will be referenced as *primary* file system for the rest of this workshop.


. *_Examine_* the *Summary* section of the file system. *_Find_* the values of the following file system attributes:
* File system ID
* Lifecycle state
* Deployment type
* SSD Storage capacity
* Throughput capacity
* Provisioned IOPS
* Availability Zones
* Creation time

. *_Examine_* the *Network & security* section of the file system. *_Click_* the *Network & security* tab. *_Find_* the values of the following file system attributes:
* VPC
* Endpoint IP address range
* KMS key ID
* Route tables
* Management endpoint - DNS name and IP address
* Inter-cluster endpoint - DNS name and IP address


. *_Examine_* the subnet attributes of the file system. *_Find_* the values of preferred and standby subnets:
* Subnets
* Availability Zones
* Network interfaces

* How would you find the VPC security groups associated to the file system?
* Hint: *_Click_* the Network interface link of the preferred subnet. From the *Details* tab of the preferred file server's ENI, *_click_* the *view inbound rules* link within the *Security groups* attribute. *_Close_* the browser tab of the *Network interface* console.

. *Return* to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console.


. *_Open_* a text editor and *_Note_* down the following values which will be used later in this workshop to create a new FSx for NetApp ONTAP file system.
* VPC ID
* Preferred subnet ID
* Standby subnet ID
* Route Table ID

. *_Examine_* the *Administration* section of the file system. *_Click_* the *Administration* tab. *_Find_* the values of the following file system attributes:
* Service account username
* Management endpoint - DNS name and IP address
* Inter-cluster endpoint - DNS name IP address
* Weekly maintenance window

. *_Return_* to the SSH connection of your *FSx for ONTAP Workshop Linux instance* and export the below values. Replace the IP with IP address of your file system management endpoint.
+
[source,bash]
----
ADMINUSER="fsxadmin"
MGMTENDPOINT="x.x.x.x"
----
+

. *Return* to the link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/fsx/[Amazon FSx] console.


==== Create a Storage virtual machine (SVM) joined to Active Directory

. *_Click_* on the *Storage virtual machines* tab of your file system. *_Click_* *Create storage virtual machine* and input the values shown here:

+
[cols="2,13"]
|===
| *File system*
a| Select the file system ID for your *primary* file system

| *Storage virtual machine name*
a| Enter svm08

| *SVM administrative password*
a| Accept the default

| *Active Directory*
a| Select - Join an Active Directory

a| Enter the Active Directory DNS server IP addresses. You can retrieve the DNS addresses using link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice[Directory Service]. *_click_* Directory ID with Directory name *example.com*. Under *Networking & Security* tab you will find two DNS addresses

| *Service account username*
a| Enter the Active Directory username created by the workshop resource. You can retrieve the username using link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager[AWS Secrets Manager]. *_Select_* Secret name *Password-GUID* and *_Click_* on *Retrieve Secret value* to get the username

| *Service account password*
a| Enter the Active Directory user password created by the workshop resource. You can retrieve the password using link:https://console.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager[AWS Secrets Manager]. *_Select_* Secret name *Password-GUID* and *_Click_* on *Retrieve Secret value* to get the password

| *Confirm password*
a| Re-Enter the Active Directory user password

| *Organizational Unit (OU) within which you want to join your file system*
a| Input *OU=Computers,OU=example,DC=example,DC=com*

| *Delegated file system administrators group - optional*
a| Accept the default

| *SVM root volume security style*
a| Accept the default
|===
+
. After you have entered or accepted values for all parameters, *_click_* *Confirm*

. It will take approximately *5 minutes* to create the new SVM. You can proceed to *Create a volume* step without waiting for the SVM to be fully available.


==== Create a volume

. *_Click_* on the *volumes* tab of your file system. *_Click_* *Create volume* and input the values shown here:

+
[cols="2,7"]
|===
| *File system*
a| Select the file system ID for your *primary* file system

| *Storage virtual machine name*
a| Select the Storage virtual machine you created

| *Volume name*
a| Input vol1

| *Junction path*
a| Input /vol1

| *Volume Size*
a| Input 100000

| *Storage efficiency*
a| Select Enabled

| *Capacity pool tiering policy*
a| Select *None*
|===
+
. After you have entered or accepted values for all parameters, *_click_* *Confirm*

. It will take approximately *2 minutes* to create the new volume. 


=== Continue Examining the file system from Amazon FSx Console

. *_Examine_* the *Storage virtual machines(SVMs)* section of the file system. *_Click_* the *Storage virtual machines* tab. *_Find_* the values of the following file system attributes:
* SVM Name
* SVM ID
* Is the SVM joined to an Active Directory?


. *_Examine_* the *Volumes* section of the file system. *_Click_* the *Volumes* tab. *_Find_* the values of the following file system attributes:
* Volume Name 
* Which SVM does the volume belong to?
* What is the junction path for the volume? 
+
TIP: Each SVM has a unique namespace with the SVM root volume being the entry point to the namespace. Do you see */* as Junction Path for the root?  You add volumes to this namespace by creating a junction path. The *vol1* volume uses */* as the entry point and has junction path */vol1*. You can create junction points directly below the parent volume or on a directory withn the volume. Ex: /vol1/vol2. You will use the junction path to mount your volume.
+
* What is the size of your volume?
* Does the volume have a Tiering Policy configured?


. *_Examine_* the *Backups* section of the file system. *_Click_* the *Backups* tab.
* Are daily automatic backups enabled?
* *_Click_* *Update* to Change backup window and retention period. Accept default values and *_Click_* *Save*.

. *_Examine_* the *Tags* section of the file system. *_Click_* the *Tags* tab.
* What tags (key/value) pairs are assigned to the file system?
* Add a new tag (key/value) pair. *_Click_* the *[Add]* button and enter a *key* / *value* of your choice (e.g. Tag Key=Name, Value=FSxOntap-primary). *_Click_* the *Save* button.



=== Create a secondary file system 
TIP: You can skip this section if you do not want to setup *SnapMirror* and *FlexCache* portions of this GitHub workshop.

*_Click_* on *FSx > File systems* above the summary section of the file system and *_click_* *Create file system* then *_Select_* *Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP* and click *_Next_*.

. You can choose between *Quick create* or *Standard create* methods.
* The *Quick create* option allows you to easily create a new file system with a *_default_* recommended configuration. The *Quick create* option creates a file system with a single SVM and one volume, allowing for quick access to data from Linux instances over the NFS protocol. 
* The *Standard create* option allows you to set all the configuration options like performance, networking , security, backups, maintenance etc. 

. *_Select_* *Standard create* and input the values as shown here:
